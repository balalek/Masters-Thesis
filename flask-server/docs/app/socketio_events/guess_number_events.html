<p>Socket.IO event handlers for Guess a Number gameplay.</p>
<p>This module provides real-time event handling for Guess a Number questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two-phase team-based gameplay with captain system</li>
<li>Free-for-all competitive guessing with proximity scoring</li>
<li>Validation and scoring of numerical guesses</li>
<li>Team voting mechanics for higher/lower comparisons</li>
<li>Exactness bonuses and placement-based point allocation</li>
<li>Tie-breaking mechanisms for team voting</li>
</ul>
<p>Guess a Number is a collaborative/competitive estimation game where players
try to guess numeric values with different mechanics based on game mode.</p>
